# StarBoard

## About the Application
This is a reactive web based status board written in Meteor.js. It is used for keeping track of when people are in or out of the 'office' and to get an idea of when they are returning, with a UI that mimics the real-world use of moving magnets between in and out columns on a board.  Here is an example of the application in action:   

http://starboard.meteor.com/

Using characters from The Office:
* login: `{{first-name}}@dunder-mifflin.io` 
* pass: `{{last-name}}` 

-or-
* login: `{{first-name}}@wernham-hogg.io` 
* pass: `{{last-name}}` 


(add 1's to bring pass to 6 characters, if too short)

## Basic Use
Drag and drop people to move them in or out of the office or between office locations. 
Double click people who are out to toggle them between working and and not working.    
  


## Setup
With Meteor installed. . .
* git clone {{repo-url}}
* cd starboard/
* meteor
